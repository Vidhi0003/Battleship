### Battleship

This was a game I created with my partner for one of my classes. This game was created using Java and JavaFX. While planning this project, we had a rough idea of what we wanted to do. My partner and I split up the work where we both worked on the frontend and the backend.

Our goal was to create a game where the user would be able to play against an AI opponent by using a client-server architecture. We also integrated Maven for efficient project management and dependency handling as well as JUnit for testing.

In order to plan this game, we also used Figma to design and prototype the user interface prior to development.
