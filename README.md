# Battleship

This was a game I created with my partner for one of my classes. This game was created using Java and JavaFX. While planning this project, we had a rough idea of what we wanted to do. My partner and I split up the work where we both worked on the frontend and the backend.

Our goal was to create a game where the user would be able to play against an AI opponent by using a client-server architecture. We also integrated Maven for efficient project management and dependency handling as well as JUnit for testing.

In order to plan this game, we also used Figma to design and prototype the user interface prior to development.

The codespaces we used to create this game were Eclipse and IntelliJ. Both of us were comfortable with these two apps as we had used them to learn Java.

### How to Play

First start the server. If you are in IntelliJ, create a Maven Configuration and write: clean compile exec:java

*Also make sure that the file directory is pointing to the correct files, otherwise errors will occur. When you start the server, this is what the screen will look like. This specific screenshot shows two players because I created two clients. The server will keep track of the number of players and the moves played.

Next, start the client. The client will look like this and you will put down five ships in order to start the game. Once, the game starts the ListView will have the events that are occurring. Here are some pictures of what the gameplay will look like.

### Conclusions

Overall, creating this game taught me a lot such as TC/IP Networking and learning how to navigate different platforms. Before this, I had never used IntelliJ and Eclipse, so this was exciting. Also, I learned how to code in Java and create a pretty cool game!
